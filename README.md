# Description
`TinyCDN` is a simple application designed to make it easy to access your 42 students' profile pictures internally.

**Why?**
You may wonder why such an application is necessary. Perhaps you want to create a static website or a simple app without the hassle of setting up a 42API connector or OAuth to retrieve your students' profile picture links. In that case, TinyCDN can help you access any of your students' pictures using the URL tinycdn.domain.nl/LE_LOGIN. This is no longer possible through 42 due to GDPR restrictions on external exposure of student profile pictures.
